      "Trey found the property and brought the family to see it. It was forested, overgrown, and the road was barely navigable. But Trey had a vision so we moved forward with the purchase and were permitted to use the property until the sale went through.",

      "We finally closed on the property! We’d been working hard over the past couple months. Most of the pine stand had been sprayed with a hardwood herbicide to prepare for burning. The main pasture was mowed and saplings piled up. Trey disced and planted the pasture into behiagrass the following spring and spent many hours mowing it.",

      "We finished our first fence on the main pasture, closing in 10 acres. Then we brought home our first herd of six Aberdeen cattle! The cattle worked excellent as lawnmowers! While we no longer raise Aberdeens, we learned a lot from them.",

    description:
      "We finally got power on the property! This allowed us to use stronger chargers for our hotwire and made camping out quieter since we no longer needed a generator. The stronger hotwire helped us in rotating cattle to ensure there was ample regrowth time between grazing areas.",

      "Did you know not just boy cattle have horns? That’s right! Both male and female Pineywoods cattle have horns! We brought home our first Pinewoods cows and we were excited to find out that two were pregnant! A couple months later, we had our first two calves born on the farm, Chris and Martin! We also purchased a herd of goats to help with clearing the understory in our silvopasture.",

    date: "Aug. 2022",
    description:
      "After over a year of hauling water on a homemade water trailer from a generous neighbors house, we finally got our very own 580’ well. This greatly decreased the time we spent hauling water to the cattle and made rotating them much easier. We use quite a few garden hoses to get water where we need it and use a float to automatically fill troughs for our growing herd. Eventually we’ll build underground pipeline.",

      "We decided to upgrade our camper to a 5th wheel and move full-time to the property. We rented our house in Charleston and have been tiny-home living! This move allowed us to oversee the farm as we continued growing. In the beginning of 2023, we built a pole barn (our first permanent structure!) for hay and equipment storage. We’ve also held classes and field days under the barn.",

      "We finished fencing another 15 acres of silvopasture, following a prescribed burn in January by the SC Forestry Commission. We needed this additional grazing area in anticipation of our first registered South Poll cattle arriving and calving! We also purchased our first meat and laying chickens and ducks. Throughout the spring and summer, Corrine raised and finished 200 Freedom Rangers and Cornish Cross chickens and 80 Pekin Ducks, and over 50 laying chickens and ducks!",

We welcomed 15 calves this spring and summer, purchased a bull, and are focusing on building our pasture health and forage quality. We sold the goats, having completed their job of clearing the understory of the silvopasture and destroying all the chicken tractors.",
